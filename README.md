# PREDICTING CUSTOMER CHURN FOR A COMMUNICATION COMPANY

Customer churn also known as customer turnover is the fraction of customers that stopped patronizing a company's products or services for a specific period. This project is a classification project which will help a telecom company understand their data, point out what is being done wrong or right and predict the possibilities of customers churning and help the company to make the right decision for the development of the company. We will build a Machine learning algorithm to predict whether customers are likely to churn or not.

This project seeks to ascertain the likelihood of turnover among customers in a Telecommunication company. This project will analyze the possible cause and predict if a customer will churn in future also suggest strategies to retain customers.

I used Python and Jupyter for this project.
